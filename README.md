#  Project Description: Online Food Ordering System
Restaurants and food outlets increasingly rely on online ordering to enhance customer convenience and streamline operations. The goal of this project is to design a software system that allows customers to browse a restaurant’s menu, place customized orders, and track deliveries or pickups. The system must support interactions among key stakeholders: customers, restaurant staff, delivery personnel, and administrators.

#  Core Functional Requirements
Menu Management:
Restaurant staff should be able to add, update, or remove menu items.
Each menu item should include details such as name, description, category (e.g., appetizer, entrée, dessert), price, and availability status.
Menu items may have customizable options (e.g., toppings, portion size, spice level).

#  Customer Registration and Profile Management:
Customers should be able to create accounts, update profiles, and manage payment preferences.
A customer’s order history should be stored for repeat ordering.

#  Order Placement and Checkout:
Customers can browse the menu, select items, customize them, and add them to a cart.
Orders can be placed for either delivery or pickup.
The system should provide real-time calculation of order totals, including taxes, discounts, and delivery fees.
Multiple payment methods should be supported (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet, cash on delivery).

#  Order Tracking:
After placing an order, customers should be able to track its status: Received, Preparing, Out for Delivery, Delivered.
Delivery personnel should update status as they progress.

#  Notifications:
Customers receive order confirmations and status updates via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.
Restaurant staff are notified when new orders arrive.

#  Delivery Management:
The system assigns delivery personnel to orders (either manually by staff or automatically).
Delivery personnel can view delivery addresses, estimated times, and order details.

#  Reports and Analytics:
Administrators and managers can generate reports about popular dishes, sales trends, order volume, and customer demographics.
Insights help with decision-making around inventory, pricing, and promotions.
